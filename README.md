## How to:

### Run tests for the smart-contracts

Contracts are located in the `contract` directory, and developed using `hardhat`.
To run all tests, navigate to the `contract` directory, install all dependencies, and run `yarn test`:
```
$ cd contract
$ yarn
$ yarn test
```

All contracts and typings should be compiled automatically.

## Client
For better user experience we have implemented a web application. 
It gives real-time access to an exchange and allows to check current market situation, to buy 
and to sell InnoCoin with ETH.
